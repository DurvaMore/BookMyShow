# BookMyShow Clone – Step 1: Landing Page

## Overview
Build a visually appealing, responsive landing page inspired by BookMyShow that showcases featured movies/shows and a browsable movie listings section — all with static/mock data (no backend needed for this step).

---

## 1. Top Navigation Bar
- BookMyShow-style header with logo/brand name
- Search bar (UI only, no functionality yet)
- City selector dropdown (UI only)
- Navigation links: Movies, Events, Shows

## 2. Hero / Featured Section
- A large banner carousel showcasing 3–5 featured movies or shows
- Each slide displays the movie poster, title, and a "Book Now" button (non-functional for now)
- Auto-advances with manual navigation dots/arrows

## 3. Movie Listings Section
- Section title: "Recommended Movies" or "Now Showing"
- Grid of movie cards (8–12 movies using mock data), each card showing:
  - Movie poster image (placeholder images)
  - Movie title
  - Genre tags (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy)
  - Rating (star or number)
  - Brief description or release date
- Cards are clickable but won't navigate anywhere yet

## 4. Genre Filter Bar
- Horizontal scrollable row of genre pills/buttons (All, Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Romance, etc.)
- Clicking a genre filters the movie cards displayed below

## 5. Footer
- Simple footer with links: About, Contact, Terms, Privacy
- Social media icons

## 6. Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Movie cards in a 4-column grid, full navigation bar
- **Tablet**: 2–3 column grid, slightly condensed nav
- **Mobile**: Single column card layout, hamburger menu for navigation, stacked hero banner

## Design Style
- Dark theme with red accent color (BookMyShow-inspired)
- Clean, modern card-based UI with rounded corners and subtle shadows
